# World Energy Consumption Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes global energy consumption trends over the past 40+ years. The analysis focuses on patterns in energy usage, compares fossil fuels with renewable energy, and highlights trends that can support sustainability discussions and energy-related decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – [World Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption)  
- **Description:** Country-level energy consumption data covering multiple energy sources across decades.  
- **Key Columns:** Country, Year, Energy Type, Consumption (TWh)

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Trend analysis across time and regions  
- Visualization of energy source comparisons  
- Linear regression / forecasting energy trends  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Global energy consumption has increased steadily since 1980.  
- Fossil fuels (coal and oil) remain dominant in many regions, though renewable energy usage is growing significantly.  
- Several countries show clear transitions toward renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.  
- Observed trends highlight opportunities and challenges for sustainable energy planning.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
